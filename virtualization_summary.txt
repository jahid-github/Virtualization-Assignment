Virtualization Summary

1. Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating virtual versions of computing resources like servers, storage, and networks.

✔ Improves resource utilization
✔ Reduces hardware costs
✔ Increases flexibility

2. Hypervisor
A hypervisor is software that allows multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine.

Types of Hypervisors:

Type 1 (Bare-metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., KVM, VMware ESXi).
Type 2 (Hosted): Runs inside an OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).
✔ Manages VM resources
✔ Ensures isolation between VMs

3. Virtual Machines (VMs)
A VM is a software-based computer that runs its own OS and applications.

Pros:
✔ Strong isolation
✔ Can run different OS types
✔ Useful for legacy applications

Cons:
✘ Higher resource consumption
✘ Slower performance compared to containers

4. Containers
Containers package applications with their dependencies, sharing the host OS kernel for efficiency.

Examples:

Docker
LXC
Kubernetes
Pros:
✔ Lightweight and fast
✔ Easy to scale and deploy
✔ Portable across different environments

Cons:
✘ Less isolation than VMs
✘ Needs proper container management

5. Differences Between VMs and Containers
Feature	Virtual Machines (VMs)	Containers
Isolation	Strong (full OS per VM)	Lightweight (shared OS kernel)
Startup Time	Slow (minutes)	Fast (seconds)
Resource Usage	High (each VM needs OS)	Low (shares OS kernel)
Portability	Harder (OS dependencies)	Easy (works across systems)
Use Case	Running different OS types	Running multiple apps efficiently

Conclusion-
Virtualization enables multiple systems on one machine.
Hypervisors manage VMs for OS-level isolation.
Containers provide fast and lightweight app deployment.
VMs are better for running multiple OS types, while containers are best for scalable applications.
